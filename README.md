# Optimization Problems in Mathematics

A curated collection of optimization problems in mathematics, focusing on problems where there is some constant C arising from an optimization problem - for instance, the best constant for which a certain inequality is true.

## Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Record known upper and lower bounds for mathematical constants arising from optimization problems
- Track progress on open problems in optimization and inequalities
- Encourage crowdsourced contributions and updates via pull requests
- Provide a centralized, accessible reference for researchers

## Structure

Each optimization problem is documented in its own markdown file in the `problems/` directory. The README provides an index of all problems.

## List of Problems

### Analysis and Inequalities

- [Sobolev Inequality](problems/sobolev-inequality.md) - Best constant in the Sobolev embedding inequality
- [Hardy Inequality](problems/hardy-inequality.md) - Optimal constant in Hardy's inequality

### Discrete Mathematics

- [Erdős-Ko-Rado Theorem](problems/erdos-ko-rado.md) - Maximum size of intersecting families

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! To add a new problem or update bounds:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create or update a problem file in the `problems/` directory (see [template.md](template.md))
3. Update this README to include a link to your problem
4. Submit a pull request with:
   - A clear description of the changes
   - Citations or references for any new bounds
   - Any relevant context or discussion
