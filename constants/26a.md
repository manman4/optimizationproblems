# Mahler volume product constant

Let $K\subset\mathbb R^n$ be a **centrally symmetric** convex body (compact, convex, with non-empty interior) satisfying $K=-K$. Its **polar body** is

$$
K^\circ := \left\{y\in\mathbb R^n:\ \langle x,y\rangle \le 1\ \text{for all }x\in K\right\}.
$$

The **volume product** of $K$ is

$$
\mathrm{vp}(K) := \mathrm{Vol}_n(K)\,\mathrm{Vol}_n(K^\circ).
$$

It is common (and convenient) to absorb the factorial and define the **Mahler volume**

$$
M(K) := n!\,\mathrm{Vol}_n(K)\,\mathrm{Vol}_n(K^\circ)=n!\,\mathrm{vp}(K).
$$

For centrally symmetric $K$, this quantity is invariant under invertible linear transformations, so it makes sense to ask for a dimension-free lower bound of the form $M(K)\ge c^n$.

The constant $C_{25}$ is the **largest** $c$ such that

$$
n!\,\mathrm{Vol}_n(K)\,\mathrm{Vol}_n(K^\circ)\ \ge\ c^n
\quad\text{for all }n\ge 1\text{ and all centrally symmetric convex bodies }K\subset\mathbb R^n,
$$

equivalently

$$
\mathrm{Vol}_n(K)\,\mathrm{Vol}_n(K^\circ)\ \ge\ \frac{c^n}{n!}.
$$

The (symmetric) **Mahler conjecture** predicts that $C_{25}=4$, with extremisers given by **Hanner polytopes** (in particular, the cube and cross-polytope).

## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| $4$ | Trivial | For the cube $B_\infty^n=[-1,1]^n$ one has $\mathrm{Vol}(B_\infty^n)=2^n$ and $\mathrm{Vol}\big((B_\infty^n)^\circ\big)=2^n/n!$, hence $M(B_\infty^n)=4^n$ and $C_{25}\le 4$. Conjecturally, this is sharp (Mahler conjecture). |

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| $c>0$ (non-explicit) | [BM1987] | Bourgain–Milman (reverse Santaló inequality): there exists a universal constant $c>0$ with $M(K)\ge c^n$ for all centrally symmetric convex bodies $K$. |
| $\pi^3/16 \approx 1.9379$ | [N2012] | Nazarov obtained an explicit constant in the symmetric Bourgain–Milman inequality (via a Hörmander/$\bar\partial$ method). |
| $\pi \approx 3.1416$ | [K2008] | Best known explicit constant to date (Kuperberg). |

* The **Blaschke–Santaló inequality** gives the *opposite* extremal problem: for any convex body (after translating to its Santaló point), the volume product is **maximized** by ellipsoids.
* The symmetric Mahler conjecture is known in low dimensions: it is true in dimensions $n\le 2$, and in dimension $n=3$ it was proved by Iriyeh–Shibata.
* There is also a **non-symmetric** Mahler conjecture (minimizers conjectured to be simplices); see the surveys below for background and many partial results (e.g. for unconditional bodies, zonoids, and other symmetry classes).
