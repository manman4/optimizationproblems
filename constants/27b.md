# Maximum Chromatic Number of Biplanar Graphs

## Description of constant

$C\_{27b}$ is the highest possible chromatic number for any biplanar graph.
## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| 12 | Trivial | Follows from the four color theorem. |

It is known that

9   ≤   $C\_{27b}$   ≤   12

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| 9 | [GA1980] | Constructed as the join of a 6-vertex complete graph and a 5-vertex cycle graph. |

## Additional comments
The value of this constant is the solution to the [Earth Moon Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93Moon_problem).
