# Romanoff's constant constant

## Description of constant

$C_{45}$ is the asymptotic density (if it exists) of the set of odd integers that can be expressed as the sum of a prime number and a power of two.

## Additional comments and links

- In the (unlikely) event that this set fails to have a density, the upper and lower bounds should be interpreted as bounds on the upper and lower densities, respectively.
- Variants of this set are studied in Erdős problems [#205](https://www.erdosproblems.com/205), [#244](https://www.erdosproblems.com/244) and [#851](https://www.erdosproblems.com/851).
